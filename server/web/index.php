            <b>This faucet consists of two phases:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>In the first phase, the faucet transfers you a very small amount so that you can use the faucet (which is technically a smart contract).</li>
                <li>In the second phase you interact with and use the faucet. This will then give you a larger amount to start with.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
